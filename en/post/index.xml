What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</description></item><item><title>Paradise</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/paradise/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:36:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/paradise/</guid><description>When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly</description></item><item><title>Californication</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/californication/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:29:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/californication/</guid><description>Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind&amp;rsquo;s elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams it&amp;rsquo;s Californication
It&amp;rsquo;s the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East at least it&amp;rsquo;s settled in a final location
It&amp;rsquo;s understood that Hollywood sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging</description></item><item><title>Yugoslavication</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/yugoslavication/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:24:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/yugoslavication/</guid><description>Vlaška magic vračare have region domination
And little girls from Pljevlja dream of Beograd central station
And if you want these kind of dreams it’s Yugoslavication
It’s the clash of the world, the West and Eastern civilization
The money may flow from the West at best it’s stolen at a sweet location
It’s understood that Hollywood hates Yugoslavication
Pay your mayor very well to break the spell of nature</description></item><item><title>Absolutely Everybody</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/absolutely-everybody/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/absolutely-everybody/</guid><description>Absolutely everybody
Everybody, everybody
Absolutely everybody
Everybody, everybody
Absolutely everybody
Everybody, everybody
Absolutely everybody
Absolutely everybody
Absolutely everybody
Absolutely everybody
Absolutely everybody
Absolutely everybody
Absolutely everybody
Everybody needs a little loving
Everybody needs somebody thinking of them
Everybody needs a little respect
And whatever it takes, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna get it
Everybody needs a hand to hold
Someone to cling to
When the nights are getting cold
I&amp;rsquo;m no different, I am just the same</description></item><item><title>At the Cross</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/at-the-cross/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/at-the-cross/</guid><description>Oh Lord You&amp;rsquo;ve searched me
You know my way
Even when I fail you
I know You love me
Your holy presence
Surrounded me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me
At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There&amp;rsquo;s no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now</description></item><item><title>Blue Jeans</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/blue-jeans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/blue-jeans/</guid><description>Blue jeans
White shirt
Walked into the room
You know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean
For sure
You&amp;rsquo;re so fresh to death and sick as c-cancer
You were sorta Punk Rock
I grew up on Hip Hop
But you fit me better
Than my favorite sweater and I know
That love is mean (uh oh)
And love hurts (uh oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby</description></item><item><title>Can't Get Better Than This</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/cant-get-better-than-this/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/cant-get-better-than-this/</guid><description>Can&amp;rsquo;t get better than this

over and over waiting for me
I faint my desire, my walk through the fire
relying to me all on my own
Will you give me back the love I want to give you
Something that will guide me through the life
Most of the faces in all different places
In a little corner of your eyes
I&amp;rsquo;m like a dreamer when you are my dream</description></item><item><title>Count To Ten</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/count-to-ten/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/count-to-ten/</guid><description>I close my eyes again
I count to 10 again
But there is no sign of my friends
My friends
I cant see any form
Because this game it has no toys
And I keep playing again
And I keep playing, playing again
Stop now, dont turn around
I keep saying, Ill keep playing
Stop now, dont turn make a sound
Keep playing, the children saying
Close your eyes, count to 10</description></item><item><title>Here In My Life</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/here-in-my-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/here-in-my-life/</guid><description>I have never walked on water Felt the waves beneath my feet But at Your word Lord I&amp;rsquo;ll receive Your faith to walk on oceans deep
And I remember how You found me In that very same place All my failings surely would have drowned me Still You made a way
You are my freedom Jesus You&amp;rsquo;re the reason I&amp;rsquo;m kneeling again at your throne Where would I be without You Here in my life Here in my life</description></item><item><title>I Turn To You</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/i-turn-to-you/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/i-turn-to-you/</guid><description>When the world is darker than I can understand
When nothing turns out the way I planned
When the sky turns gray and there&amp;rsquo;s no end in sight
When I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep through the lonely night
I turn to you
Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
&amp;lsquo;Cause you&amp;rsquo;re the only one
Who can turn me around
When I&amp;rsquo;m upside down
I turn to you</description></item><item><title>I Walk alone</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/i-walk-alone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/i-walk-alone/</guid><description>I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don&amp;rsquo;t know where it goes
But it&amp;rsquo;s home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I&amp;rsquo;m the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a-
My shadow&amp;rsquo;s the only one that walks beside me</description></item><item><title>La Isla Bonita</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/la-isla-bonita/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/la-isla-bonita/</guid><description>Last night I dreamed of San Pedro
Just like I&amp;rsquo;d never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I love to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes</description></item><item><title>Mad About You</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/mad-about-you/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/mad-about-you/</guid><description>Feel the vibe
Feel the terror
Feel the pain
It&amp;rsquo;s driving me insane
I can&amp;rsquo;t fake
For God&amp;rsquo;s sake why am I driving in the wrong lane
Trouble is my middle name
But in the end I&amp;rsquo;m not too bad
Can someone tell me if it&amp;rsquo;s wrong to be so mad about you
Mad about you
Mad
Are you the fishy wine who will give me a headache in the morning</description></item><item><title>My Heart Will Go On</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/my-heart-will-go-on/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/my-heart-will-go-on/</guid><description>Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you&amp;rsquo;re here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time</description></item><item><title>My Rifle My Pony And Me</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/my-rifle-my-pony-and-me/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/my-rifle-my-pony-and-me/</guid><description>The sun is sinkin&amp;rsquo; in the west
The cattle go down to the stream
The Red wing settles in her nest
It&amp;rsquo;s time for the cowboy to dream
Purple light in the canyon
That&amp;rsquo;s where I long to be
With my three good companions
Just my rifle, pony and me
Gonna hang my sombrero
On the limb of a tree
Comin&amp;rsquo; home, sweetheart darlin&amp;rsquo;
Just my rifle, pony and me</description></item><item><title>Someone Like You</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/someone-like-you/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/someone-like-you/</guid><description>I heard that you&amp;rsquo;re settled down
That you found a girl and you&amp;rsquo;re married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn&amp;rsquo;t give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain&amp;rsquo;t like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stay away, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fight it</description></item><item><title>Summertime Sadness</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/summertime-sadness/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/summertime-sadness/</guid><description>Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin&amp;rsquo; in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I&amp;rsquo;m feelin&amp;rsquo; alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin&amp;rsquo; like a snare
Honey, I&amp;rsquo;m on fire, I feel it everywhere</description></item><item><title>Things Will Never Be The Same (Roxette cover)</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/things-will-never-be-the-same/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/things-will-never-be-the-same/</guid><description>Lay it down
Pull my heart to the ground
Time&amp;rsquo;s getting cold
Now the leaves all turn hard and blue
And I know
When I gaze to the sun
No place to hide
I got nowhere to run from you
Away from you
Hold me now
Girl, I don&amp;rsquo;t know when
When we will ever meet again
That was then
Baby, this is now
I try to get over you</description></item><item><title>What You Know</title><link>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/what-you-know/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://djvelimir.github.io/en/post/music/what-you-know/</guid><description>In a few weeks I will get time
To realize it&amp;rsquo;s right before my eyes
And I can take it if it&amp;rsquo;s what I want to do
And I am leaving and this is starting to feel like
It&amp;rsquo;s right before my eyes
And I can taste it
It&amp;rsquo;s my sweet beginning
And I can tell just what you want
You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be alone
You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be alone</description></item></channel></rss>

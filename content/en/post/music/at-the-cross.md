Oh Lord You've searched me  
You know my way  
Even when I fail you  
I know You love me

Your holy presence  
Surrounded me  
In every season  
I know You love me  
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees  
Where Your blood was shed for me  
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave  
Glory fills the highest place  
What can separate me now

You go before me  
You shield my way  
Your hand upholds me  
And I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee  
Where Your blood was shed for me  
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave  
Your glory fills the highest place  
What can separate me now

At the cross I bow my knee  
Where Your blood was shed for me  
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave  
Glory fills the highest place  
What can separate me now

You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done

And when the earth fails  
Falls from my eyes  
And You stand before me  
I know You love me  
Oh, I know You love me

At the cross I bow my  
Where Your blood was shed for me  
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave  
Glory fills the highest place  
What can separate me now

At the cross I bow my knee  
Where Your blood was shed for me  
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave  
Glory fills the highest place  
What can separate me now

You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done

You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done

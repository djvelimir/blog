Feel the vibe  
Feel the terror  
Feel the pain  
It's driving me insane  
I can't fake  
For God's sake why am I driving in the wrong lane  
Trouble is my middle name  
But in the end I'm not too bad  
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you

Mad about you  
Mad

Are you the fishy wine who will give me a headache in the morning  
Or just a dark blue land mine that will explode without a decent warning  
Give me all your true hate and I'll translate it in our bed  
Into never seen passion, never seen passion  
That's why I am so mad about you

Mad about you  
Mad

Trouble is your middle name  
But in the end you're not too bad  
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you

Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad

Give me all your true hate and I'll translate it in your bed  
Into never seen passion  
That is why I am so mad about you

Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you

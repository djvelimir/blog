When the world is darker than I can understand  
When nothing turns out the way I planned  
When the sky turns gray and there's no end in sight  
When I can't sleep through the lonely night

I turn to you  
Like a flower leaning toward the sun  
I turn to you  
'Cause you're the only one  
Who can turn me around  
When I'm upside down  
I turn to you

When my insides are racked with anxiety  
You have the touch that will quiet me  
You lift my spirit, you melt the ice

When I need inspiration, when I need advice  
I turn to you  
Like a flower leaning toward the sun  
I turn to you  
'Cause you're the only one  
Who can turn me around  
When I am upside down  
I turn to you

Where would I be?  
What would I do  
If you never helped me through?  
I hope some day if you've lost your way  
You can turn to me (you can turn to me)  
Like I turn to you

I turn to you  
Like a flower leaning toward the sun  
I turn to you  
'Cause you're the only one  
Who can turn me around  
When I'm upside down  
I turn to you

I turn to you  
When fear tells me to turn around  
I turn to you  
'Cause you're the only one  
Who can turn me around  
When I'm upside down  
I turn to you  
I turn to you  
I turn to you

Lay it down  
Pull my heart to the ground  
Time's getting cold  
Now the leaves all turn hard and blue  
And I know  
When I gaze to the sun  
No place to hide  
I got nowhere to run from you  
Away from you

Hold me now  
Girl, I don't know when  
When we will ever meet again  
That was then  
Baby, this is now  
I try to get over you

Losing you  
Things will never be the same  
Can you hear me call your name?  
If we changed it back again  
Things would never be...

In your hand  
Babe, I don't understand  
You've got the eyes of a child  
But you hurt like a man, always do  
Always do

Touch me now  
Girl, I don't know when  
When we will ever meet again  
That was then  
Baby, this is now  
Time won't get over you

Losing you  
Things will never be the same  
Can you hear me call your name?  
If we changed it back again  
Things would never be...

Losing you  
Things will never be the same  
Can you hear me call your name?  
If we changed it back again  
Things would never be the same  
Things will never be the same  
Can you hear, can you hear me call your name?  
If we changed it back again  
Things would never be the same

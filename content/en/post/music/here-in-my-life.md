I have never walked on water
Felt the waves beneath my feet
But at Your word Lord
I'll receive Your faith to walk on oceans deep

And I remember how You found me
In that very same place
All my failings surely would have drowned me
Still You made a way

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

You have said that all the heavens
Sing for joy at one who finds the
Way to freedom, truth of Jesus
Brought from death into this life

And I remember how You saw me
Through the eyes of Your grace
And though the cost was Your beloved for me
Still You made a way

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm knelling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

Last night I dreamed of San Pedro  
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song  
A young girl with eyes like the desert  
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze  
All of nature wild and free  
This is where I love to be  
La isla bonita  
And when the samba played  
The sun would set so high  
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes  
Your Spanish lullaby (lullaby, lullaby, your Spanish lullaby)

I fell in love with San Pedro  
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me  
Te dijo te amo  
I prayed that the days would last  
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze  
All of nature wild and free  
This is where I love to be  
La isla bonita  
And when the samba played  
The sun would set so high  
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes  
Your Spanish lullaby (lullaby, lullaby, your Spanish lullaby)  
I want to be where the sun warms the sky  
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by  
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world  
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy  
Loves a girl

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro  
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

Tropical the island breeze  
All of nature wild and free  
This is where I love to be  
La isla bonita  
And when the samba played  
The sun would set so high  
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes  
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze  
All of nature wild and free  
This is where I love to be  
La isla bonita  
And when the samba played  
The sun would set so high  
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes  
Your Spanish lullaby

Island breeze  
Wild and free  
La isla bonita  
Samba played  
Set so high

Island breeze  
Wild and Free  
La isla bonita  
(Ah) Samba played  
Set so high

Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this

Can't get better than this  
I don't wanna be nowhere else, I said  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this  
I don't wanna be nowhere else  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this

I don't wanna go away  
I watched this happen every day  
I'm looking at the bright lights  
But still I'm chasing fireflies  
We don't know where we are  
But we're still dancing on a star  
Now we're looking at the bright lights  
But I was still chasing fireflies

Can't get better than this  
I don't wanna be nowhere else, I said  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this  
I don't wanna be nowhere else  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this

I don't wanna go away  
I watched this happen every day  
I'm looking at the bright lights  
But still I'm chasing fireflies  
We don't know where we are  
But we're still dancing on a star  
Now we're looking at the bright lights  
But I was still chasing fireflies

Can't get better than this  
I don't wanna be nowhere else, I said  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this  
I don't wanna be nowhere else  
Can't get better than this  
Can't get better than this

The sun is sinkin' in the west  
The cattle go down to the stream  
The Red wing settles in her nest  
It's time for the cowboy to dream

Purple light in the canyon  
That's where I long to be  
With my three good companions  
Just my rifle, pony and me

Gonna hang my sombrero  
On the limb of a tree  
Comin' home, sweetheart darlin'  
Just my rifle, pony and me

Whippoorwill in the willow  
Sings a sweet melody  
Riding to Amarillo  
Just my rifle, pony and me

No more goats to be ropin'  
No more strays will I see  
'Round the bend she'll be waitin'  
For my rifle, pony and me  
For my rifle, my pony and me

I'm like a river when you are the sea  
over and over waiting for me  
I faint my desire, my walk through the fire  
relying to me all on my own

Will you give me back the love I want to give you  
Something that will guide me through the life  
Most of the faces in all different places  
In a little corner of your eyes

I'm like a dreamer when you are my dream  
Forever and ever looking for me  
For secrets from heaven I open my eyes  
I'm waiting for golden Sun to rise

Will you give me back the love I want to give you  
Something that will guide me through the night  
Most of the faces in all different places  
In a little corner of your eyes

Will you give me back the love I want to give you  
Something that will guide me through the night  
Most of the faces in all different places  
In a little corner of your eyes

Will you give me back the love I want to give you  
Something that will guide me through the night  
Most of the faces in all different places  
In a little corner of your eyes

Will you give me back the love I want to give you  
Something that will guide me through the night  
Most of the faces in all different places  
In a little corner of your eyes  
Will you give me back the love

that will guide me through the night

of the faces in all different places  
In your eyes

Will you give me back  
Will you give me back the love

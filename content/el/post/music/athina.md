[Verse 1]  
You, you have everything I need  
Only you, only you can set me free  
Tonight I need to be in your arms  
Tonight I am giving you my heart  
'Cause you're my desire  
You're the place in my dreams

[Chorus]  
Αθηνά, there's a fire burning  
Deep inside your eyes tonight  
And you make my heart beat faster  
Oh, Αθηνά  
Will you take me on your wings so I can fly?  
Αθηνά, Αθηνά

[Verse 2]  
I need you more than words can say  
And I miss you so when I'm away  
This time you will hold me in your hands  
This time I will make you understand  
'Cause you're my desire  
You're the place in my dreams

[Chorus]  
Αθηνά, there's a fire burning  
Deep inside your eyes tonight  
And you make my heart beat faster  
Oh, Αθηνά  
Will you take me on your wings so I can fly?  
Αθηνά, Αθηνά

[Bridge]  
Γιατί γόρης εσένα μια ζωή να ζω  
Δεν το αντέξω, δεν πόρο  
'Cause you're my desire  
You're the place in my dreams

[Chorus]  
Αθηνά, there's a fire burning  
Deep inside your eyes tonight  
And you make my heart beat faster  
Oh, Αθηνά  
Will you take me on your wings so I can fly?  
Αθηνά, Αθηνά  
Αθηνά, Αθηνά
